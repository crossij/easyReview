\subsection{Getting started}
% ------
% ------
\subsubsection{A minimal file}
\label{sec:minimal}
% ------
Before using the listings package, you should be familiar with the \\LaTeX~typesetting
system. You need not to be an expert. Here is a minimal file for using easyReview:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=tex]
%*\keyword{$\backslash$documentclass}*){article}
%*\keyword{$\backslash$usepackage}*){easyReview}

%*\keyword{$\backslash$begin}*){document}

% Write your text here and use.
% You will be able to use the easyReview commands.

%*\keyword{$\backslash$end}*){document

\end{lstlisting}

Now, type in this first example and run it through \\LaTeX.

\begin{description}
 \item[* Should I read the software license before using the package?:] Yes, but read this \textit{Getting started} Section first to decide whether you are willing to use the package.
 \item[* The example doesn't work:] The easyReview package requires that four other packages must be installed (but himself, of course) in the way for working properly: \textbf{\textit{soul, xcolor,} and \textit{todonotes}}. Please, be sure that the \\LaTeX~engine and \textit{all} these packages are installed before trying the given example (or any other easyReview utilization).
\end{description}

% ------
\subsubsection{Loading the package}
% ------
As usual in \\LaTeX, the package is loaded by ``\keyword{$\backslash$usepackage}\{easyReview\}''.

% ------
\subsubsection{Figure out the appearance}
% ------
``alert'' is typeset in red; ``add'' in blue; ``remove'' in strikethrough red; ``substitute''/``replace'' are equivalent commands which appear as a combination of both ``remove'' and ``add'' commands; ``highlight''  is typeset with yellow background; and ``comment'' appears as an inline box with orange background.

\subsection{Turning reviews ON or OFF}
% ------
It is possible to turn the reviews ON or OFF. In some extent, it is possible to say that, when the reviews is turned off, they were not accepted. In the following, it is possible to see an example:

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=tex]
%*\keyword{$\backslash$setreviewson}*)
This text will receive the reviews. The Easy Review package is intended to be used for reviewing (or in editorial process) of %*\keyword{$\backslash$TeX}*)~documents, such as research papers, reports, books, presentations %*\keyword{$\backslash$textit}*){etc}. By using this package, %*\keyword{$\backslash$alert}*){the authors can %*\keyword{$\backslash$textbf}*){easily} claim attention to special parts of the text} %*\keyword{$\backslash$highlight}*){using different ways!} In this small example, you will be able to see the whole that the Easy Review package have.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=tex]
%*\keyword{$\backslash$setreviewsoff}*)
This text will not receive the reviews. %*\keyword{$\backslash$replace}*){For obtaining}{In the way to obtain} the final version of the \TeX~document, the authors will need to perform a lot changes over the original text. In this sense, it would be very interesting to have an available package which could turn easy the task of highlight some changes: %*\keyword{$\backslash$alert}*){alert a phrase ou period}; %*\keyword{$\backslash$highlight}*){highlight another \TeX~ content}; %*\keyword{$\backslash$add}*){add specific parts in the text}; %*\keyword{$\backslash$remove}*){remove another parts}; or even %*\keyword{$\backslash$replace}*){substitute}{replace} parts of the text. Another very important feature would be %*\keyword{$\backslash$comment}*){using special commands to let a comment to the group.}{This feature is really important!}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\hspace{10pt}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{0.45\textwidth}
For obtaining the final version of the \TeX~document, the authors will need to perform a lot changes over the original text. In this sense, it would be very interesting to have an available package which could turn easy the task of highlight some changes: alert a phrase or period; highlight another \TeX~ content; remove another parts; or even substitute parts of the text. Another very important feature would be using special commands to let a comment to the group.
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

% ------
\subsection{Changing the default colors}
% ------
The default colors used in the commands are provided by the \textit{xcolor} package. It is possible to change all colors but the highlight color. To change the command colors, use on of these assignments:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=tex]
%*\keyword{$\backslash$renewcommand}*){%*\keyword{$\backslash$alertColor}*)}{%*\keyword{$\backslash$textcolor}*){%new alert color%%*\}\}*)
%*\keyword{$\backslash$renewcommand}*){%*\keyword{$\backslash$removeColor}*)}{%*\keyword{$\backslash$textcolor}*){%new remove color%%*\}\}*)
%*\keyword{$\backslash$renewcommand}*){%*\keyword{$\backslash$addColor}*)}{%*\keyword{$\backslash$textcolor}*){%new add color%%*\}\}*)

\end{lstlisting}

\section{Troubleshooting}
\label{sec:troubleshooting}
If you're faced with a problem with the listings package, there are some steps you should undergo before you make a bug report. First, create a minimal file which reproduces the problem. Follow these instructions:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Start from the minimal file in Section \ref{sec:minimal};
 \item Add the \LaTeX code which causes the problem, but keep it short. In particular, keep the number of additional packages small;
 \item Remove some code from the file (and the according packages) until the problem disappears. Then you've found a crucial piece;
 \item Add this piece of code again and start over with step 3 until all code and all packages are substantial;
 \item You now have a minimal file. Send a bug report to \url{jody.matos@inf.ufrgs.br} and include the minimal file together with the created \textit{.log-file}. If you use a very special package (i.e., one not on CTAN), also include the package if its software license allows it.
\end{enumerate}

% ------
\section{The Next Steps}
% ------
Now, before actually using the \textit{easyReview} package, you should really read the software license. It does not cost much time and provides information you probably need to know.

% ------
\subsection{Software License}
% ------
The file \lstinline!easyReview.sty! and all files generated this file are referred to as ‘the Easy Review package’ or simply ‘the package’.
